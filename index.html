            <span class="ponstl">CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets</span>, and it is used to design and style web pages. With CSS, developers can control
            colors, fonts, spacing, layouts, and overall appearance of a website. It separates the content from design, which makes
            websites easier to manage and update. Without CSS, web pages would look plain and boring. CSS helps make websites
            visually attractive, user-friendly, and professional. It plays a very important role in modern web development.CSS also helps maintain consistency across a website by applying the same styles everywhere. It makes the design cleaner
            and more organized. This is why CSS is a core technology of the web.

            One of the biggest advantages of CSS is that it saves time and effort. A single CSS file can control the design of
            multiple web pages at once. This means changes can be made quickly without editing every page. CSS also helps in
            creating responsive designs that work well on different screen sizes like mobile, tablet, and desktop. Because of
            CSS,
            websites can adapt smoothly to different devices and give users a better experience.Responsive design has become very important in today’s digital world. CSS media queries help achieve this flexibility
            easily. As a result, users enjoy smoother browsing on all devices.
