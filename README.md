# CSS Basic Day-02 Assignment

This repository contains my **Day-02 CSS practice project**, created as part of my web development learning journey. The project focuses on practicing **HTML structure, CSS styling, and layout design** using various elements such as headings, paragraphs, divs, lists, and images.

## Project Features

- Three styled paragraphs with different background colors, text colors, and spacing.
- A heading section with a clean and centered main title (`h1`) and section titles (`h2`).
- List boxes showing **"Without CSS"** and **"With CSS"** examples.
- Styled divs with **border, border-radius, box-shadow**, and top-right corner styling.
- Gallery section with multiple images using inline-block display and simple shadows.
- Proper use of **class and tag selectors** in CSS.
- Demonstrates **line-height, font-family, font-size, letter-spacing**, and text alignment styling.
- Fully responsive and visually structured layout suitable for beginners.
